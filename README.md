## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Select number of variables** (2, 3, 4, or 5) using buttons on the main screen.
2. **Fill the truth table** with desired outputs:
   - `1` for **true**
   - `0` for **false**
   - `X` for **don't care**
3. Press the **Calculate** button.
4. Get the **simplified boolean expression** instantly.
